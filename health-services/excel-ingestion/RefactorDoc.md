# **High-Priority Refactoring Opportunities**

## 🏗️ 1. Service Extraction

* **MDMS Integration** → Schema-fetching logic embedded inside processors.
* **Boundary Data Processing** → Business rules mixed with Excel creation code.
* **Excel Security** → Protection logic scattered across multiple classes.

# **Medium-Priority Refactoring Opportunities**

## 🎨 2. Missing Common Utilities

* **Excel Formatting** → Column widths, freeze panes, and styling logic repeated.
* **Name Validation** → Multiple variations of `makeNameValid()` across the codebase.
* **Sheet Name Handling** → 31-character limit logic repeated in multiple places.
* **Data Validation** → Dropdown creation logic duplicated in different processors.

## 🔧 3. Pattern & Structure Improvements

* **Error Handling** → Similar try-catch API call patterns across services.
* **Interface Contracts** → `IGenerateProcessor` missing a `generateExcel()` signature for consistency.
