## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Current Service Architecture & Stats

### **Service Overview**
The `excel-ingestion` service is a sophisticated Spring Boot 3.2.2 microservice built with Java 17, designed to generate complex multi-sheet Excel templates for health campaign data management.

### **Current Statistics**
* **Total Files**: 42 Java files + configuration/documentation files
* **Code Volume**: ~4,100+ lines of Java code
* **Architecture**: Clean layered microservice with processor-based pattern

### **Component Breakdown**
* **7 Core Services**: Excel generation, boundary management, localization, MDMS integration, file store, API payload building
* **20+ Model Classes**: Including new `Boundary`, `FileStoreResponse`, `FileInfo` models with Jakarta validation
* **4 Utility Classes**: Specialized Excel sheet creators for different purposes  
* **2 Processor Implementations**: Microplan and hierarchy-based Excel generation
* **1 REST Controller**: Clean API interface with validation
* **8 Configuration/Exception Classes**: Robust error handling and configuration management

### **Key Architectural Patterns**

* **Builder Pattern**: Lombok-enhanced model construction
* **Caching Strategy**: Caffeine cache for external service data (1-hour expiry, 100 max entries)

### **Recent Major Enhancements (Latest Session)**
1. **Boundaries Feature Implementation**
   - Dynamic boundary hierarchy population from request payload
   - Last-level filtering with `includeAllChildren` expansion logic
   - Hidden boundary code column for backend integration

2. **Level Localization Standardization**
   - Unified `HCM_CAMP_CONF_LEVEL_*` usage across campaign config and dropdowns
   - Level mapping sheet (`_h_LevelMapping_h_`) for consistent key-value handling
   - Maintained dropdown functionality with proper Excel formulas

3. **Hidden Sheet Naming Standardization**
   - All hidden sheets use `_h_SheetName_h_` format consistently
   - Updated formula references across both processors
   - Improved maintainability and debugging

4. **FileStore Service Enhancement**
   - Proper model classes (`FileStoreResponse`, `FileInfo`) replacing raw Maps
   - Better JSON parsing and error handling
   - Type-safe response processing

5. **Model Cleanup & API Enhancement**
   - Removed redundant `locale` field from `GenerateResource` (using RequestInfo)
   - Enhanced validation with `Boundary` model class
   - Cleaner API contracts with consistent localization fallbacks

### **Previous Major Improvements (Claude-Driven)**
1. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Three-tier exception handling system
   - CustomExceptionHandler for service-level errors with context
   - ValidationExceptionHandler for input validation with custom error codes  
   - GlobalExceptionHandler for standardized health services error responses

2. **Advanced Validation System**: Jakarta validation with custom error codes
   - GenerateResource model with @NotBlank, @Size annotations
   - Custom error codes like "INGEST_MISSING_TENANT_ID"
   - Cascade validation with @Valid annotations

3. **MDMS Integration Refactoring**: Generic utility function replacing duplicate code
   - Single mdmsSearch function with filters, limit, offset parameters
   - Eliminated code duplication across multiple service calls

4. **Service Quality Enhancements**:
   - Excel sheet protection with password locking
   - Color-coded headers and cell formatting
   - Cascading dropdown validations with boundary relationships
   - Multi-language localization support

### **Integration Capabilities** 
* **External Services**: Boundary-service, MDMS-service, Localization-service, File-store
* **Caching Layer**: Distributed caching for boundary hierarchy, localization messages
* **File Management**: Automated Excel upload to external file store with unique IDs

### **Code Quality Indicators**
* **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns with service/utility/model layers
* **Error Safety**: Comprehensive error constants and exception handling patterns
* **Type Safety**: Moving from Map<String, Object> to proper model classes (5-phase migration plan)
* **Logging**: SLF4J logging throughout with proper error tracking

This reflects a **mature, well-architected microservice** with sophisticated Excel generation capabilities and enterprise-grade error handling - all primarily **authored by Claude CLI** with targeted refactoring guidance.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Usage Cautions

‚ö† **Best Practices When Using Claude Max for Refactoring**

* **Review all suggestions** carefully ‚Äî some changes may be inaccurate.
* **Test all working cases** before committing.
* **Commit small, functional changes** instead of large refactors.
* After each refactor, **validate all use cases** again and then commit.
* **Multiple refactoring iterations may be needed** ‚Äî Claude gets the logic mostly right and is always accurate, but refactoring-wise you may need to iterate a few more times to achieve the desired structure.
* **Monitor each change closely** ‚Äî check what files Claude is editing and verify the changes before proceeding.
* **Refactor incrementally** ‚Äî break large refactoring tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and validate each change.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Recommended Practice for Ongoing Improvements

Maintain a **dedicated `.md` file** to log changes and architectural decisions.
Updating it regularly ensures Claude Max (and future developers) always have **accurate project context**, enabling **better and more relevant refactoring suggestions**.

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Side Issues Fixed via Claude CLI

### **1. YAML Duplicate Code Detection**
* **Issue**: Duplicate configurations in service YAML files (visible in logs but easy to miss).
* **Solution**: Copy-pasted logs into Claude CLI within cloned DevOps config repo.
* **Result**: Claude automatically detected the service ‚Üí identified YAML ‚Üí found duplicate code ‚Üí fixed it.

### **2. Kafka Message Size Optimization in Project Service**
* **Issue**: Message size increases dramatically when updating project dates.
* **Investigation**: Asked Claude to check Kafka persistence in project-service for date change behavior.
* **Finding**: Claude discovered that date updates were cascading to all child entities, sending entire bulk project arrays as single Kafka messages.
* **Solution**: Implemented batch processing with batches of 100 projects.
* **Result**: Reduced Kafka message size and improved system stability.
