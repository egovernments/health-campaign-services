## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Claude's Limitations & How to Work Around Them

### **Known Limitations**
* **Context Blindness**: May miss related code in other files/packages without explicit direction
* **Pattern Assumptions**: Sometimes applies patterns from other frameworks incorrectly
* **Partial Fixes**: May fix one occurrence but miss duplicate logic elsewhere (e.g., v1/v2 endpoints)
* **Over-Engineering**: Can suggest complex solutions for simple problems
* **Large Task Complexity**: For big tasks (like creating comprehensive test suites), requires iterative debugging and fixing through multiple Claude CLI sessions - can take 1+ hours of back-and-forth

### **Best Practices to Avoid Issues**
* **Provide Full Context**: Always mention related files, API versions, and dependencies
* **Incremental Changes**: Make small changes and test before proceeding
* **Explicit Instructions**: Specify exact locations (e.g., "check both v1 and v2 endpoints")
* **Create CLAUDE.md Guidelines**: Define coding standards, dependency injection patterns, eGovernments standards, and project-specific rules for consistent development
* **Verify Suggestions**: Review generated code always
* **Test Immediately**: Test after each change to catch issues early
* **Commit Working Code**: Save progress frequently with small, functional commits

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Side Issues Fixed via Claude CLI

### **1. YAML Duplicate Code Detection**
* **Issue**: Duplicate configurations in service YAML files (visible in logs but easy to miss).
* **Solution**: Copy-pasted logs into Claude CLI within cloned DevOps config repo.
* **Result**: Claude automatically detected the service ‚Üí identified YAML ‚Üí found duplicate code ‚Üí fixed it.

### **2. Kafka Message Size Optimization in Project Service**
* **Issue**: Message size increases dramatically when updating project dates.
* **Investigation**: Asked Claude to check Kafka persistence in project-service for date change behavior.
* **Finding**: Claude discovered that date updates were cascading to all child entities, sending entire bulk project arrays as single Kafka messages.
* **Solution**: Implemented batch processing with batches of 100 projects.
* **Result**: Reduced Kafka message size and improved system stability.

### **3. Project Service Search API Reference ID Bug**
* **Issue**: Project search API throwing "pass any field to search" error even when referenceId was provided in search body.
* **Investigation**: Opened Claude CLI in projects folder and described the issue.
* **Finding**: Claude found the validation logic was only checking for null values with AND operator, needed to include referenceId check.
* **First Fix**: Changed validation in one place (v2 search endpoint) - Claude confirmed it would work.
* **Problem**: Fix didn't work because the validation existed in two places (v1 and v2 search endpoints).
* **Final Solution**: Had to tell Claude to add the same fix in v1 search endpoint as well.
* **Learning**: Always check for multiple occurrences of similar validation logic across different API versions.
