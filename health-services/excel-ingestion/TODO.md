# TODO - Processed File Validation Fix

## ✅ Issue Resolved
Processed files (from process API) show validation warnings in cells + error columns. Should only show error columns.

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- [x] Detect when processing files and clean up validation formatting
- [x] Remove conditional formatting from processed files
- [x] Remove cell comments from processed files  
- [x] Lock processed file sheets for protection
- [x] Keep error columns working

## ✅ Implementation
Added `ValidationService.removeValidationFormatting()` method that:
1. Removes all conditional formatting from sheets 
2. Removes validation cell comments from data rows
3. Locks the entire sheet with password "processed" for protection
4. Called automatically when adding error columns during file processing

## ✅ Result
- Template files: validation warnings in cells ✅
- Processed files: clean cells, errors only in columns, fully locked ✅
